# Next Steps

Frontend from Backstage, cloud from Crossplane, compute environment from
Kubernetes and finally CI/CD that ties all this together; we have the power to
build our own internal cloud platform!

A few ideas as next steps:
* Have templates for different languages.
* Add input parameters to templates that will let devs choose what cloud
  resources they need.
* Different clusters configured with different `Composition`s to fulfill the
  needs while keeping the Helm charts same!
* Add more tools! Everything is on Kubernetes API!
